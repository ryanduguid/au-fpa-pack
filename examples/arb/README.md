Every figure traces to [`data/SOURCES.md`](data/SOURCES.md).

## Four phases

**Phase A** reproduces FY2025 operating mechanics from actual drivers (sales
mix, materials as COGS, WC days, D&A, PPE capex). Gross profit is constructed.
This is arithmetic, not a forecast.

**Phase B** holds FY2025 out. A uniform 16.4 percent growth challenger is
discarded. An export-led challenger with 150bps margin compression is proposed,
not promoted.

**Phase C** forecasts FY2026–FY2027 from the August 2025 4E view.

**Phase D** is a labeled Thai Baht / US-tariff sensitivity (+150bps COGS). It is
not a kernel FX engine.

## Where the engine strains

1. PDF transcription, not XBRL.
2. No channel EBITDA in the filing: allocated from consolidated EBIT + D&A.
3. Trade receivables used as AR, not the broader receivables line.
4. No FY2023 balance sheet in this 4E, so Phase A is FY2025 only.
5. Franking, associates (ORW), and acquisitions are outside the engine.
6. GST/BAS belongs to Harbour Light, not this annual public proof.
