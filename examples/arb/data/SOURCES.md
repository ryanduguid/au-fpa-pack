ARB does not disclose channel EBITDA. The model allocates consolidated EBITDA
(EBIT + D&A) by sales mix so the engine has a Segment object. That allocation
is a modelling choice, not a filing line.

## Honest strain

- PDF transcription, not an XBRL pull. Re-check the PDF before treating a
  figure as authoritative.
- Thai Baht and US auto/steel/aluminium tariffs are a **labelled sensitivity**
  (+150bps COGS), not a kernel FX/tariff engine.
- Franking credits ($112,022k) and special/final dividends are documented in
  the filing and not modelled.
- No FY2023 balance sheet in this 4E, so Phase A reproduces FY2025 only.
- GST/BAS is the Harbour Light example. ARB is an annual public proof.
