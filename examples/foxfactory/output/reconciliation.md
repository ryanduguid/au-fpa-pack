# Phase A - Actual-driver accounting reproduction

The pyfpa engine is driven with Fox Factory's **actual** reported drivers
(segment net sales, blended COGS%, working-capital days, D&A, capex) and
its output is compared to the reported figures. This proves the accounting
mechanics reproduce known outcomes; it is **not** an independent forecast
validation because the target-year drivers are inputs. Tolerance: 1%.

`operating_cash_flow_before_tax` is a constructed proxy on both sides:
segment Adjusted EBITDA plus the balance-sheet working-capital cash
movement. It is not the reported cash-flow statement, which also carries
interest and other operating adjustments.

## What the engine does not model (documented bridge)

- **FY2025 goodwill impairment of $557.3M** (non-cash) - drove GAAP operating
  income to -$522.9M and a -$544.6M net loss even as revenue recovered. The
  lean engine models the operating business; the impairment is a discrete
  non-cash item shown here, not forced through the engine.
- **Discrete tax items** - Fox booked tax *benefits* in FY2024/FY2025; the
  engine's tax model only taxes positive income, so net income is bridged
  separately, not reconciled here.
- This phase therefore validates the **operating arithmetic and the
  working-capital cash mechanic**, while Phase B below provides the
  independent historical holdout.
