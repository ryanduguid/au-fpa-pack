"""Accounting depreciation for a forecast, from evidence held on disk.

Three things stay apart here, because a model that mixes them produces a
plausible cash forecast that is wrong:

- **Depreciation expense** reduces profit and moves no cash.
- **An asset purchase** moves cash on its own date, which is usually not the
  date the charge begins.
- **Tax** is a separate assumption. An AASB 116 carrying amount is not a
  deduction under ITAA 1997 Division 40, the two use different lives and
  conventions, and nothing in this module produces a tax figure.

`load_evidence` reads a calculation-evidence file something else produced. It
opens no socket and calls no service, which is what makes this usable in a
default model run: the figures were obtained once, deliberately, and committed
or kept beside the workspace.

`asset_movement` closes or refuses. If opening plus additions less depreciation
does not equal closing, it says so and names the gap. It never derives the
addition that would close it, because a number computed to make a
reconciliation pass is not evidence of anything.
