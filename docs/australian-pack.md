## Australian pack (fork extension)

This fork adds an Australian localisation in `pyfpa/au/`, built on the
data-access-recipe and industry-pack paths in CONTRIBUTING:

- **Calendar** - 30 June financial years, `FY2027` / `Q1 FY2027` /
  `1H FY2027` labels, dd/mm/yyyy (`pyfpa.au.calendar`)
- **Payroll** - super guarantee, state payroll tax (all 8
  jurisdictions, effective-dated), workers comp, leave provisions,
  contractors (`pyfpa.au.payroll`)
- **GST/BAS** - net GST from GST-exclusive series, monthly and
  quarterly settlement schedules, straight into the 13-week model
  (`pyfpa.au.gst`)
- **Xero** - report parser with tracking-category and GST-basis
  detection plus the full register/map/reconcile recipe
  (`pyfpa.io.xero_au`, [`docs/recipes/xero-au.md`](../docs/recipes/xero-au.md))
- **Economic drivers** - RBA cash rate and exchange rates, ABS CPI/WPI/
  retail/labour series, snapshotted with provenance
  (`pyfpa.au.drivers`, [`docs/recipes/au-drivers.md`](../docs/recipes/au-drivers.md))

Statutory rates are effective-dated YAML data files with official
source URLs, verified at revenue offices (2026-08-20). Simplifications
(grouping, QLD taper, WA diminishing threshold, surcharge tiers) are
documented in the module docstrings. Not tax software: forecast-grade
cash and P&L modelling only.

```python
from pyfpa.au import PayrollAssumptions, Role, payroll_forecast
from pyfpa.au.calendar import fy_month_range

frame = payroll_forecast(
    [Role(name="Engineer", annual_salary=150000, jurisdiction="VIC")],
    fy_month_range(2027),
)
```

Skills: `fpa-au-payroll`, `fpa-au-gst-bas`, `fpa-au-xero`, `fpa-au-drivers`.

### Worked GST assumptions

GST-free sales and input-taxed sales both exclude output GST, but their
purchase-credit treatment can differ. Set `taxable_sales_pct` and
`creditable_purchases_pct` independently from reviewed transaction evidence.
A sales percentage does not establish a purchase-credit percentage.

These fabricated scenarios use monthly revenue of $12,000 and purchases of
$4,000, excluding GST, with the bundled 10% rate. The creditable share is an
explicit scenario assumption, with all other credit conditions assumed met.

| Scenario | Taxable sales share | Creditable purchases share | Output GST | Input GST | Net GST |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Taxable sales, fully creditable purchases | 100% | 100% | $1,200 | $400 | $800 |
| GST-free sales, fully creditable purchases | 0% | 100% | $0 | $400 | -$400 |
| Input-taxed sales, no credit entitlement | 0% | 0% | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| Mixed sales and independently reviewed purchases | 50% | 75% | $600 | $300 | $300 |

```python
import pandas as pd
from pyfpa.au.gst import GstAssumptions, bas_schedule, monthly_gst

months = pd.period_range("2026-07", periods=3, freq="M")
gst = monthly_gst(
    pd.Series(12000.0, index=months),
    pd.Series(4000.0, index=months),
    GstAssumptions(taxable_sales_pct=0.5, creditable_purchases_pct=0.75),
)
assert gst["net_gst"].tolist() == [300.0, 300.0, 300.0]
assert bas_schedule(gst["net_gst"])["amount"].tolist() == [900.0]
```

The Library's *GST / Claiming Input Tax Credits · Tax Invoices*, creditable-purpose
discussion, and *Accounting Basis · Tax Periods*, paragraph 7-000, prompted
these examples. Authority checked on 10 September 2026: [GST Act, compilation
dated 1 January 2026](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A00446/2026-01-01/2026-01-01/text/original/epub/OEBPS/document_1/document_1.html),
ss 9-70, 11-5, 11-15, 11-25 and 11-30. Financial-supply exceptions and reduced
credits require separate assessment; the zero-credit example does not decide them.

`monthly_gst` applies supplied proportions; it does not classify transactions or
attribute invoices and payments to tax periods. Reconcile cash-basis inputs before
using them. The schedule uses original BAS due dates, without weekend, holiday or
agent extensions; a refund on that date is a forecast assumption, not a receipt
promise. Explicit rate overrides must be finite and non-negative. Zero remains
available for scenario modelling; it does not establish a GST exemption.

Worked examples on this fork:

- [`examples/harbour-light/`](../examples/harbour-light/) - synthetic VIC
  wholesaler: Xero mapping, statutory payroll, quarterly BAS into 13-week cash,
  verified Excel.
- [`examples/arb/`](../examples/arb/) - ARB Corporation (ASX: ARB) from the FY2025
  Appendix 4E. Annual public proof, not a GST model.

This fork is not a claim to be upstream.
