## Overview

The channel-level forecast tells you the business is healthy; it doesn't tell you *which products* carry it. This skill computes per-SKU economics and the Pareto curve so you can see the 80/20, find margin-dilutive SKUs, and make cut/reprice/push calls.

**Core principle:** Revenue flatters; margin and contribution decide. Rank by gross profit, not by sales.

## When to use

- 'Which products actually make money?' / 'what should we cut?'
- Product-mix, pricing, or assortment-rationalization decisions
- Any product business with a discrete SKU set (especially limited-SKU brands)

## Workflow

1. **Load the SKUs** (annual units, price, unit cost):
   ```python
   import pyfpa
   skus = pyfpa.load_skus("examples/ridgeline/skus.yaml")   # or build [Sku(...)] inline
   df = pyfpa.sku_profitability(skus)
   ```
   `df` is sorted by revenue (desc) so the Pareto columns read top-down, indexed by SKU,
   with columns: `units, revenue, cogs, gross_profit, gross_margin, revenue_share,
   cumulative_revenue_pct`. For a profit ranking, re-sort it:
   `df.sort_values("gross_profit", ascending=False)`. A high-revenue SKU can sit at the
   top of the revenue order while contributing less gross profit than a smaller one.

2. **Find the 80/20**:
   ```python
   n = pyfpa.pareto_breakpoint(df, threshold=0.8)   # SKUs that make 80% of revenue
   ```

3. **Read the signals**:
   - **Top of the gross-profit order** (after re-sorting by `gross_profit`) - protect and push these.
   - **High revenue, low `gross_margin`** - reprice or renegotiate cost; they're buying share with your margin.
   - **Low `revenue_share` AND low margin** - candidates to cut (carrying cost without contribution).
   - **The Pareto tail** - if the bottom SKUs add complexity (SKUs to manage, inventory to hold) without margin, rationalize them.

4. **Recommend** in business terms: which SKUs to push, reprice, or discontinue, and the margin impact of each move.

## Judgement checks (see fpa-cfo-judgment)

- `gross_margin` here is **gross profit divided by revenue, as a fraction** (`0.05` means 5%), built from listed price and unit cost only - it excludes channel fees, returns, and fulfilment. A D2C SKU and a wholesale SKU at the same listed margin are not equally profitable once channel economics hit.
- A 'high-margin' SKU with tiny volume may not be worth the operational complexity it adds. Weigh contribution dollars, not just the percentage.
