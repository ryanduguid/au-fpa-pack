# Contributing to openfpa

openfpa is an open-source experiment from [Guiderail](https://www.guiderail.io). It's
early, and help is genuinely welcome, whether that's a bug report, a sharper piece of
CFO judgement, or a whole new industry pack. No promises on response time, and please be
kind; this is a side-of-the-desk project.

## Getting set up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryanduguid/au-fpa-pack
cd au-fpa-pack
pip install -e ".[dev]"
ruff check .       # lint and import order, part of the merge gate
mypy               # strict type check of pyfpa, part of the merge gate
pytest -q          # the merge gate, and it should be green
pytest -m network  # the live checks, which fetch RBA CSVs over the internet
```

CI runs `ruff check .` and `mypy` before the test matrix, so a lint or typing
failure stops the run early. `ruff check . --fix` applies the safe fixes.

`mypy` checks against Python 3.11, the floor in `requires-python`, and CI runs it
on a 3.11 environment. Run it on 3.11 too: on 3.12 or newer, pip resolves numpy
2.5, whose stubs use syntax mypy will not parse while targeting 3.11, and you get
an error inside `numpy/__init__.pyi` rather than anything about your change.

`pytest.ini` deselects the `network` marker by default, so a Reserve Bank outage or a
published layout change cannot fail a branch that did not cause it. Run `pytest -m
network` when you touch `pyfpa/au/drivers.py` or refresh the RBA fixtures under
`tests/fixtures/`.

The distribution is `au-fpa-pack`; the importable package is `pyfpa` (`import pyfpa`).

The openpyxl minimum is 3.1.3. Earlier versions can retain workbook file handles
on Windows with Python 3.11.8 or newer, preventing verified exports from replacing
their destination. See [openpyxl issue 2149 in its release notes](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changes.html).
CI runs the minimum-dependency suite on both Linux and Windows.

## The workflow

1. Fork, branch, and make your change.
2. **Add tests for new behaviour.** The project is test-first, and CI runs the suite on
   Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14. A green suite is required to merge, as are clean
   `ruff check .` and `mypy` runs.
3. Open a PR describing what you changed and why. For anything non-trivial, describe the
   approach in a draft PR before you build: Issues are switched off in this repository, and
   changes to the shared openfpa core belong in [openfpa's issues](https://github.com/JeffBrines/openfpa/issues).

## What's most useful to contribute

The engine is deliberately lean; the value is in the skillset and how widely it covers
real businesses. The contributions that help most:

- **Industry packs:** a polished generated skill for a vertical the toolkit doesn't cover
  well yet (SaaS, restaurant, logistics, agency, and so on). The `fpa-learn-business` skill
  spins these up per business; a generalised, well-documented one helps everyone. See the
  `segment-rollup` skill in the Fox Factory example for the shape.
- **Data-access recipes:** teach the agent how to identify, request, map, test,
  and reconcile a source such as QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, Stripe, a bank
  export, or a local reporting folder. Reusable primitives are welcome, but live
  company connectors should remain generated for that company. See
  `examples/foxfactory/pull_edgar.py` for the pattern.
- **CFO judgement rules:** a real-world gotcha worth encoding into `fpa-cfo-judgment`.
- **Public-company proofs:** apply the workflow to another source-traced public
  company with honest accounting reproduction, a historical holdout, and clear
  forecast limitations.

## House rules

- **No real client data, ever, and no secrets.** Use synthetic data or public filings
  only (the Fox example uses nothing but public SEC data). Credentials come from the host
  environment or an MCP server, never committed.
- Keep modules small, pure, and immutable; config is pydantic-validated; disk I/O stays in
  the `io/` layer. Match the surrounding style.
- Open-sourced under MIT. By contributing, you agree your work is offered under the same.

## Release checks

The release caller names the component checks that must have succeeded for the
exact release commit on `main`. It advances the policy SHA, `required-checks`
and `actions: read` together. Skipped, missing, cancelled or failed checks block
publication, including component tests skipped by a path filter. An aggregate
gates job cannot replace those checks. Before tagging, choose a main-branch
commit with successful component CI; a successful run for an older commit is
not evidence for the release. Tags and publication still require explicit approval.
